## Ideas to implement OpenXML support ##

Existing open source library that can read write OpenXML:

  * [ExcelPackage](http://www.codeplex.com/ExcelPackage), however this depends on .NET 3.0. We possibly can use the library implementation in Mono to fill the gap.
  * [ExcelXmlLibrary](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/office/excelxmllibrary.aspx), the author expressed interest on implementing OpenXML support as well. The API of this library looks pretty good.
